Mine 07 
----
Initial concept: A fusion between the 1980s game 'Adventure' (Top-down POV) and platform games to create a dynamic experience of exploration. 

The player(s) will explore an abandoned mine shaft, an odyssey of stories and sidequests which lead them deeper into the earth. The general movement of the different levels
will be top-down pov. They'll search rooms, fight enemies, find things, and make friends. Entering different caverns or doorways brings on a platform POV. These platform levels 
are going to be mainly used for puzzles and storyline advancement. 
As the game continues the player builds out their discovered map-- there will be multiple ways through the game resulting in different endings.

STORY CONCEPT: Based on the Lost Dutchman gold mine in Arizona and a novice miner has found it. What they find is not only gold but, a world of trapped souls. A curse laid by a wizard
(the dutchman) will trap the miner there forever unless they can defeat the evil wizard. Guided by a skeleton, the miner advanced through layers of the mine. Nine layers.
